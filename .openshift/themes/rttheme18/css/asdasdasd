<p class="pFranson">Dr Franson has been a mentor of mine for 11 years now. As a student he provided me with a clear vision of how Chiropractic transforms lives. His passion and fire for what he does is unparalleled.

Six years into my personal practice I found myself burned out. So naturally I chose Dr. Franson to be my coach.

After 6 months of coaching, I can say that my passion for what I do has returned.

For the first time in practice, I feel like I am no longer in my own way. He has re-established protocols and procedures that have revitalized my practice and myself.

Personally I’m happier. I have better balance with my work and family because I have a coach that practices what he preaches.

Professionally, I now run my business like a business. I have protocols and procedures that allow for better communication.

With Dr. Franson’s coaching my patients just don’t believe in Chiropractic , they truly understand chiropractic.

Collections are up weekly volume is up , retention is up my marketing is streamlined , my stats reflect my practice and I love what I do again. Every coach that I have ever had, coaches from the sidelines.

Having a coach that is still in the game really helps.

Be Well,
