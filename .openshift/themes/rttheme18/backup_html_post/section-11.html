<h2 class="team_title section_title">WARNING: Choices or Consequences?</h2>
<div><center><span class="hr_title"></span><img class="arrow_down" src="http://theremarkablepractice.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/arrow_down.png" alt="" /><span class="hr_title"></span></center></div>
I heard a saying once: “You can have your choice, or you can have your consequence”…

The idea was that you can choose one or the other… but you can’t always have both…

Why?

Because choices have natural consequences…

That’s why it’s important to choose the thing that has the natural outcome you LIKE…

Look – I’m not trying to be harsh here… but I’m willing to make you a little mad if it’ll save your life and the lives of your patients…

You see, chances are really high that if you’ve read this far, you know that you need to take action… you know that you need to join The Remarkable Practice Academy…

Yet for some reason you still haven’t done what you know you need to do…

So let’s take a look at what the natural consequence of your delay will be if you don’t act in the next four days…

The first consequence is that you’ll miss the lowest price you’ll ever get on your membership… and you’ll miss out on some incredible bonuses…

But the bigger picture is about your LIFE…

Will your practice get better on its own?

Are you going to stay trapped in the practice that you have created?

Will your practice still be here in 5 years?

Will you be able to live the lifestyle you want to enjoy?

How will you continuously attract new patients?

Will you have to depend on insurance to get by?

Will you continue to lose patients?

If you don’t act now, will you be able to retire?

Will you become a slave to your practice, your patients and your staff?

These are the issues at stake…and there are consequences

These are the issues that you will begin to solve the moment you join The Remarkable Practice Academy and start to implement what you learn…

Don’t wait until you’re burnt out and ready to quit… or worse – until it’s too late…

<div class="pFranson custom-icon-quote-left">I had been in private practice for 4 years before I met Dr Franson and started coaching. I had done reasonably well in practice during those initial years through molding together bits and pieces I learnt from university, other practitioners and simple trial and error. Despite my success I never felt as if I had cracked that magic formula of running my practice smoothly. Practicing was physically and mentally tiring, resulting in poor patient experiences.

</div>
<div class="pFranson">Training with Dr Franson for the past 2 years has resulted in exponential growth of both my practice and me as a chiropractor. Practicing is now a joy and with greater ease, as doc taught me how to say more with fewer words. The results are a more enjoyable patient experience as communications are simple yet informative and concise. My practice is now filled with people who know why they want to be there and why everyone they know should be there too!

<div class="pFranson custom-icon-quote-right">As chiropractors, our schools empower us with skills to be a great doctor; much like a builder given basic building materials. Training with Dr Franson is like having a master architect help you form a blue print to utilize those building materials in building the masterpiece that is you and your dream practice.</div>
