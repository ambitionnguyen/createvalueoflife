Just the raw information and systems you need to build a remarkable life, while growing a remarkable practice…

<strong>Here’s Just a TASTE of what’s inside…</strong>

And because I know you’re busy, rather than dump everything on you all at once and leave you overwhelmed with where to start – I’ve broken everything down into weekly modules that will take you about an hour to complete…

(Anyone committed to growth can carve out an hour to work on growing their practice each week)…

That means you’ll receive 52 actionable modules – complete with staff training, scripts, flowcharts, processes and the like –<span class="spec_text"> in just the first 12 months alone… </span>

And each “module” is a complete “experience” all by itself… complete with video instruction for you and your staff, PDF transcripts you can print and read, printable slides with sections for taking notes…

Even word-for-word scripts you can use right out of the box in your practice – or easily customize to make them your own…

There’s so much we’ll cover, it’s impossible to describe it all on one page – but here’s a closer look at what you’ll be mastering in just the first month…

Month one consists of four “Board Meetings” that will help you gain CLARITY, energize your TEAM and create the CERTAINTY that will make you the talk of your town…

<div class="custom-section-title">Module 1: Remarkable Vision Casting</div>
In week one, we’ll hold your first “Board Meeting” to set the vision for your practice…

But beyond just setting the vision so that you can feel warm and fuzzy about it, you’re going to learn how to spread that vision through your team so that they OWN it and strive each day to make it a reality…

This clarity of purpose will unite your team and give you the first skill of every great business owner:

<div class="custom-section-title">Module 2: Remarkable Product and Process</div>
In week two, we’ll dive into how you ADD VALUE to your patients’ lives…

We will unpack you SYSTEMS - your PROCESS AND PROCEDURES - to create a greater CLARITY than you have ever achieved.

CLARITY drives CERTAINTY and CONVICTION...the keys to ATTRACTION, CONVERSION and most importantly - RETENTION.

<h2 class="team_title section_title custom-align-center">How to Quickly Convey the Unique Value You Provide Your Patients In Words
They Can Understand…</h2>

<div class="normal-content">
But nobody is waking up in the morning and Googling “lifetime family wellness care”…

So if we’re going to attract, convert and retain patients, we’re going to have to define the value that you provide your patients…
<strong>and put it into words they understand…</strong>

Without using a bait and switch – or a diluted “just get them started…we’ll transform them later” approach to New Patient Conversion…

They actually <strong>WANT</strong> and are <strong>LOOKING FOR</strong> what you offer…they simply don’t know that you as a chiropractor provide it…

But we’ll draw this out of you so that when you speak with your patients – and when your staff speaks with your patients – you deliver a consistent message that resonates with potential patient…

We will teach you how to <strong>BUILD THE BRIDGE</strong> of communication – so that your New Patients will convert and <strong>START CARE</strong> for the same reasons that they will <strong>STAY UNDER CARE</strong> – and re-sign – year after year.

We’ll start with the 30,000 foot view of what you would really love to provide to your patients: Lifetime Family Wellness Care – the “telescopic view”… then zoom into the “binoculars view” of what the first 2-3 years looks like… then we’ll zoom in again to what the first year looks like… then the first 3-4 months (the magnifying glass)…this is where the detail fills in and we can create real <strong>CLARITY</strong> for your process – for you, for your Team and for the patients…

And remember: <span class="spec_text">  Your retention is simply a reflection of your clarity!  </span>

It is my experience that we can do the first 90 to 120 days perfectly. Your Team can get their heads around this…… and when you NAIL those first 3-4 months perfectly, you create lifetime patients…

But your patients will never make it to the 3 month mark if you don’t nail the first 3 or 4 visits…

And this will be the focus of the next set of modules in The Remarkable Practice Academy…

The Remarkable Conversion Process…

Here you’ll learn how to get the first 3 or 4 visits dialed in perfectly, so that you convert your new patients to long term care…

And then how to get the first 3 to 4 months just right so that you convert long term care patients into lifers because-conversion and long term care are just the natural consequence of doing this first 90 – 120 days right…

<div class="custom-section-title">Module 3: Remarkable Goal Setting</div>
In week three we’re going to define your 12 month goals… and the metrics that we’ll use to measure them…

If you are not setting clear and compelling goals for you and your Team to smash, you do not stand a chance of ever creating the practice of your dreams.

We will not let that happen to you.

Then in week four the rubber really starts to meet the road because we’re going to take your goals from week three and create your roadmap to success by defining how we will accomplish them…

Here you’ll create your marketing plan and put it all together in a marketing calendar and implement the proven “done with you” marketing that will <strong>drive your business growth for the next 12 months</strong>…
